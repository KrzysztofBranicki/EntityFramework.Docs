# Entity Framework 6 Quick Overview

Entity Framework (EF) is a tried and tested data access technology with many years of features and stabilization. The first version of Entity Framework was released in 2008, as part of .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and Visual Studio 2008 SP1. Starting with the EF4.1 release it has shipped as the [EntityFramework NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFramework/) - currently one of the most popular packages on NuGet.org.

This documentation provides information on Entity Framework 6 (EF6), the latest major version of EF, although much of it also applies to past versions.

Entity Framework uses an open development model. Find out how you can help make EF even better by visiting the CodePlex site.

## What is Entity Framework

Entity Framework (EF) is an Object/Relational Mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data access code that developers usually need to write.

Using the Entity Framework, developers issue queries using LINQ, then retrieve and manipulate data as strongly typed objects. The Entity Frameworkâ€™s O/RM implementation provides services like change tracking, identity resolution, lazy loading, and query translation so that developers can focus on their application-specific business logic rather than the data access fundamentals.  

### High-level capabilities   

- Entity Framework works with a variety of database servers (including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and DB2)  
- Includes a rich mapping engine that can handle a wide variety of database schemas and works well with stored procedures  
- Provides integrated Visual Studio tools to visually create entity models and to auto-generate models from an existing database. New databases can be deployed from a model, which can also be hand-edited for full control  
- Provides a Code First experience to create entity models using code. Code First can map to an existing database or generate a database from the model.  
- Integrates well into all the .NET application programming models including ASP.NET.

Entity Framework is built on the existing ADO.NET provider model, with existing providers being updated additively to support the new Entity Framework functionality. Because of this, existing applications built on ADO.NET can be carried forward to Entity Framework easily with a programming model that is familiar to ADO.NET developers.  

### Benefits

Using Entity Framework to write data-oriented applications provides the following benefits:  

- Reduced development time: the framework provides the core data access capabilities so developers can concentrate on application logic.  
- Developers can work in terms of a more application-centric object model, including types with inheritance, complex members, and relationships. From Entity Framework 4, it also supports Persistence Ignorance through Plain Old CLR Objects (POCO) entities.  
- Applications are freed from hard-coded dependencies on a particular data engine or storage schema by supporting a conceptual model that is independent of the physical/storage model.  
- Mappings between the object model and the storage-specific schema can change without changing the application code.  
- Language-Integrated Query support (called LINQ to Entities) provides IntelliSense and compile-time syntax validation for writing queries against a conceptual model.
