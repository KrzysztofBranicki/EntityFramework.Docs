# Get Started with Entity Framework
This page provides an index of videos and tutorials to help you get started with Entity Framework. The following sections are included on this page.

## Which workflow should I use?

Entity Framework allows you to create a model by writing code or using boxes and lines in the EF Designer. Both of these approaches can be used to target an existing database or create a new database. This short video explains the differences and how to find the one that is right for you.

Find out about the EF Designer and Code First and which one is best for you.
